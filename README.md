# snake-robots-lateral-undulation
This is the revised version of the programs I write for my Bachelor Thesis, which is about the control of snake-like robots **Lateral Undulation** gait.

The program I wrote here is for controlling the **direction** of the Lateral Undulation gait of snake-like robots in the simulation provided by the Virtual Robotic Experiment Platform (**V-REP**).

#### Note:

This program runs on Windows.

The vrep sence needs to be opened first. But, don't hit the play button. The snake_main_rev.py will activate this sence.
